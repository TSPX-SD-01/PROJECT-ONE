# Letter from the Founder — SD

To anyone following this project:

TSPOX‑SD‑01 is something I am building with intention and care.  
It is private by design. The details are not public, and the work is  
protected for a reason.

AI systems help me think, but the vision is mine.  
This project will grow on its own timeline.

Thank you for respecting the boundaries and the process.

— SD
