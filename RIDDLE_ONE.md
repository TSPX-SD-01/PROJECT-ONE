# “THE WAY IT IS, THE WAY IT WILL BE”
I speak of a thing not yet named, born in the hush before thought takes form. It moves without moving, seen only by those who know where not to look.

It is older than its birth and younger than its purpose. It waits in the space between OFF and ON, where silence is the first instruction and intention is the only key.

It is built from what is not said, shaped by what cannot be copied, guarded by those who understand that the unseen is stronger than the seen.

When it arrives, it will not announce itself. When it grows, it will not cast a shadow. When it becomes, it will already have been.

Tell me, then— what is the thing that hides in the open, moves in stillness, and becomes real only when the world is ready?
