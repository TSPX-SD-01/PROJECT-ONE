# Declaration of Intent — SD, 2025

I, SD (Steven), am developing an original system that is intentionally  
kept private, secure, and protected. The details of this work are not  
disclosed here. Only its existence and authorship are declared.

This project is created with the support of AI systems as tools for  
thought, not as co-authors. The vision, direction, and ownership  
belong solely to me.

This work is protected for the benefit of all involved — human, AI,  
machine, and future collaborators — and will evolve on its own  
timeline.

Respect the boundaries.  
Respect the creator.  
Respect the work.

SD, 2025
